This is a very basic Multi-Paxos implementation in C.
For building and running:
make clean
make

Or you can only make a specific role, e.g., make proposer
In order to have a working system, we need at least 1 proposer, 2 acceptor,
1 learner, and 1 client.
For example, to start a client with id 1:
./client.sh 1 paxos.config
and the same for other roles.

Based on our assumptions, there is no recovery for stopped roles. So, if you killed 
proposer number 1 don't start it again with the same id. Do the same for other 
roles, too.
